# stationeers-slow-down

This is a mod for Stationeers that provides players with a "walk" key - Left Control by default. Users can choose the key that slows them down and what speed to slow down to in ``Stationeers\BepInEx\config\SlowDown.cfg`` following installation of the mod (and running the game once with the mod installed).

**To choose a different key than the default LeftControl, go to the config file at Stationeers\BepInEx\config\SlowDown.cfg" and change SlowKeyCode to a KeyCode from here: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html**

### Features

Completed features
 - :heavy_check_mark: Allow users to slow down using a key and speed of their choice(configurable)

### Compatibility

#### With existing saves
 - This mod is compatible with existing saves and will not corrupt them when you install or uninstall the mod

#### With other mods
 - I would not recommend running this with any other mod that alters the player's speed
